		I don't know where the sun goes every night, every night.
		
			Or where the moon goes, when it's light, when it's light.

			I don't mind, as long as it's there in time.


			Oh, as long as they're there in time,
			
			I won't mind, I won't mind, I won't mind.

			No one knows where the soul goes when we die, when we die.

			Some say to nowhere, some will say the sky, to the sky.

			It's all the same, but surely some will find it strange.

			But I prefer the mystery remains,

			Unexplained, unexplained, unexplained.

			Oh my god, I will hold my tongue,

			And I'll breathe easily,

			If anyone can say with any sort of certainty that there is something to believe.

			Did you ever think that we'd be three steps from the ledge,

			Contemplating awful things and thinking about the end?

			Nobody mentioned that the pieces wouldn't fit,

			You can rearrange them all you want, but the puzzle it was rigged.

			We swore we'd never stray,

			Right before we went our separate ways.

			And now we're looking back,

			We're second guessing all the choices that we made.

			Who'd have thought we'd fought so long,

			We started to see our enemies turn into friends, our friends to enemies

			And we set somewhere in between.

			But I heard someone say,

			They knew that someday,

			That everything would fall into it's place.

			And everything would be fine.

			And I really, truly, honestly,

			Without a doubt want to believe,

			That everything will be alright.

			Oh my god, I will hold my tongue,

			And I'll breathe easily,

			If anyone can say with any sort of certainty that there is something to believe.

			Did you ever think that we'd be three steps from the ledge,
